    "homeExtraParagraph1": "At Garcia Family Medicine, we’re different, and different is better – especially when it comes to healthcare. We understand the importance of one’s mental and physical health, which is why we operate outside the traditional health insurance system. Our practice offers better, more convenient, and less expensive primary and mental health care, without the hassle and high prices of health insurance.",
    "homeExtraParagraph2": "Direct Primary Care (DPC) is not insurance. It’s an innovative healthcare option that allows patients quality care at an affordable price. Our patients pay a low monthly subscription membership for unlimited care – including same day or next day appointments – and discounted rates for testing. We offer several packages to accommodate as many needs as we can. Using this model, not only do we offer unparalleled access to providers, we are able to build genuine relationships with our patients. We value our community and the wellness of its people.",
    "homeExtraParagraph3": "Due to the way our direct primary care service works, we do not accept health insurance. We provide membership rates for standard medical care that are more affordable than insurance – we are an option to replace insurance in some areas of healthcare. We also do not accept health insurance for self-pay individual visits for non-members."
